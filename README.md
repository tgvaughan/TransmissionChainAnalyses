# CH Phylodynamic Analysis Files

This repository contains the files necessary to reproduce the Swiss
SARS-CoV-2 phylodynamic analyses presented in Nadeau et al. 2021.

In order to run the analyses you will need a machine running
either GNU/Linux or MacOS.  You will also need to have the
following software installed:

- BEAST 2.6 (https://beast2.org/)
- BDMM-Prime (https://github.com/tgvaughan/BDMM-Prime)
- feast (https://github.com/tgvaughan/feast)

Once these are installed, follow the instructions given in the files
`CH/README.md` (Swiss analyses) and `NZ/README.md` (NZ analyses) to
reproduce the results.
